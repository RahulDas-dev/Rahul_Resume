During my time at TCS, I was able to expand my expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image processing, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. Besides Python, I've used Javascript and Typescript to create dashboards and visualizations. With my skills, I believe there are countless opportunities to use them in industry best practices and continue to learn.",
