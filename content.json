During my time at TCS, I was able to expand my expertise in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Linear Algebra, and Statistics. Apart from Python I often used Javascript, Typescript to build visualisations and dashboard. With my abilities, I believe there will be countless opportunities to use them with industry best practises and learn further.",
